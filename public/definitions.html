        <p><b>Financial Aid:</b> Money that schools give to students to help the student pay for their school. Usually, the student doesn't have to pay this money back.</p>
        <p><b>FAFSA:</b> A form that your parents have to fill out. It provides the government financial info about your family, which helps them figure out how much money they should give to help you pay for college.
        </p>
        <p><b>CSS Profile:</b> Similar to the FAFSA, only this time it’s the schools that are figuring out how much money they should give you.
        </p>
        <p><b>EFC:</b> Expected Family Contribution
        </p>
        <p><b>Demonstrated financial need:</b> The school’s price minus your EFC.
        </p>
        <p><b>Full need met:</b> A school fully satisfies your family’s demonstrated financial need with grants, scholarships, and sometimes (tiny)government loans.
        </p>
        <p><b>TinyDebt Ratio:</b> (Also called “ratio” throughout the site.) The ratio of accepted students that applied for financial aid and had their need fully met. In other words, the ratio of tiny debt versus potentially big debt students at a school. (There wasn’t a word for it.)</p>
        <p><b>The barbell college list(only applies to private-schools):</b> Don't apply to any targets because their TinyDebt ratio is low. Instead, do safeties to get merit aid and reaches with high ratios to get full need met.
        </p>
        <p><b>Something to keep in mind:</b> The closer a school’s full price is to your EFC, the less its ratio matters. This is why your in-state public schools are always a great option.</p>
